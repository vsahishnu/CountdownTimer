This is my 4th app in Kotlin. Experience:

(1)  There is an importable Lib for CountdownTimer as well. But it works in terms of
milliseconds, so make sure to convert milliseconds to mins/second in the right way.

(2) I haven't added suppport for data save but I found out you can save varible's values
 on change of instance. This can be used to transfer timeleft data to make this app
 compatable for data save on instance change.
